# AmazingSpace

Welcome!
This is just my personal works for Java coding, so if you're reading this, you probably already know me.
The releases tab is usually for my executable jar files, so if they're in a zip,
then that means it requires libraries to run, and the .dll files need to be in the same directory.
Enjoy sifting through my life!
