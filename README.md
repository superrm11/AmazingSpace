# AmazingSpace

Welcome!
This is just my personal works for Java coding, so if you're reading this, you probably already know me.
The releases tab is usually for my executable jar files, so if they're in a zip,
then that means it requires libraries to run, and the .dll files need to be in the same directory.
Enjoy sifting through my life!

PS. if this is Alex, its ArduinoJavaExample you're looking for. Under releases, grab the arduino .ino file
already under the first release. The zip file contains a runnable jar file of the program that I made. Yes, I know, it 
is a terrible layout, but I'm working on the next version. Attach the servo data pin to pin 3, and you're good to go.
